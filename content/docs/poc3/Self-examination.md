To further identify the issue, there are two more items to be verified on your mainboard:

1. the **Production Mode**
2. the **FLC (Flexible Launch Control)**

Among them, **the former is a must to enble Phala pRuntime docker**. If it's not supported (tagged as âœ˜ in the report example below), we are afraid you can't mine PHA with this mainboard.

The latter is not a must though, it is suggested to be checked as it would be essential to install the DCAP driver. And DCAP driver can be a necessary requirement to mine PHA in the future.

If you can't run Phala pRuntime docker with both of them tagged as âœ”, you may have to check whether your BIOS is the latest version with latest security patches.
If you still can't run Phala pRuntime docker with the latest BIOS of your mainboard manufacturer, we are afraid you can't mine PHA with this mainboard.

To testify your mainboard, please type in the following command for DCAP driver:

```bash
docker run -ti --rm --name phala-sgx_detect --device /dev/sgx/enclave --device /dev/sgx/provision phalanetwork/phala-sgx_detect
```

or the following one for SGX driver:

```bash
docker run -ti --rm --name phala-sgx_detect --device /dev/isgx phalanetwork/phala-sgx_detect
```

The report below would be a positive result:

ðŸ•®  Flexible launch control > CPU configuration
Your hardware supports Flexible Launch Control, but it's not enabled in the BIOS. Reboot your machine and try to enable FLC in your BIOS. Alternatively, try updating your BIOS to the latest version or contact your BIOS vendor.

debug: MSR 3Ah IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL.SGX_LC = 0
