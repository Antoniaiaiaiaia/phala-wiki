title: 1.4 Enable SGX Driver
---

First, identify your driver type:

- Type in command `ls /dev | grep isgx` and if there comes a feedback, your computer is SGX-driver-driven and it works.
- Type in command `ls /dev | grep sgx` and if there comes a feedback, your computer is DCAP-driver-driven and it works.

As long as either type of driver works, your computer will be ready to mine PHA.

If neither of the types works, please type in the commands below to install DCAP driver:

```bash
sudo apt-get install dkms
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.9/linux/distro/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.36.2.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.36.2.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver_1.36.2.bin
```

After installation, retype `ls /dev | grep sgx` to check whether the installation succeeds. If the DCAP driver is not enabled, please try following commands to install SGX driver.

```bash
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.11/distro/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.6.0_b0a445b.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.6.0_b0a445b.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.6.0_b0a445b.bin
```

Use `ls /dev | grep isgx` again to ensure that SGX driver works.
